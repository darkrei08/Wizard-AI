A production-ready Express.js boilerplate built with TypeScript, designed to provide a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for your next Node.js API project. This template comes with essential features like strong security, high code quality, and developer-friendly tools, enabling you to focus on building your application while ensuring maintainability and performance right from the start.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛠 Core Functionality

- **Web framework**: Fast and minimalist web application framework using [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- **Logging**: Advanced logging with [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) and [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- **Schema validation**: Ensure the integrity of incoming requests (query params, body) using [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod)
- **Environment Variable Management**: Ensures all required environment variables are present and properly validated using [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod)
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error management system
- **Signal handling**: Gracefully handles OS signals like `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` to ensure proper cleanup and shutdown of the application
- **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation using [zod-openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-openapi), seamlessly integrated with Zod schemas to provide always up-to-date API documentation

### 🔒 Security Features

- **CORS protection**: Manage cross-origin requests with [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)
- **Helmet**: Help secure Express apps by setting HTTP response headers with [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet)
- **Rate limiting**: Safeguard the API against excessive requests and potential DDoS attacks with efficient middleware provided by [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)
- **Secure authentication**: Robust JWT-based authentication implemented using [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken), [jwks-rsa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwks-rsa) and [jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode). Public keys are fetched from Microsoft’s identity platform, tokens are decoded and verified, and user informations (like `username` and `groups`) are extracted. Tokens are validated against audience and issuer claims to ensure only authorized clients can access the API.

### 💻 Code Quality

- **Code formatting**: Consistent code style with [oxfmt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxfmt)
- **Linting**: Enforce best practices and maintainable code with [oxlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxlint)
- **Git Hooks with Husky**: Automated quality gates using [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to enforce standards on every commit:
  - **Pre-commit hook** — Runs the following checks before allowing a commit:
    - Unit tests to prevent commits that would break the test suite
    - Lint and format staged files via [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) (oxlint auto-fix + oxfmt)
      ```json
      {
        "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["npm run lint:fix"],
        "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,html,css}": ["npm run format"]
      }
      ```
    - `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
    - TypeScript type checking to catch type errors

  - **Commit-msg hook** — Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format using [commitlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli)

### 📖 API Documentation

This boilerplate includes automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation that keeps your API docs always in sync with your code.

#### Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Documentation is automatically generated from your Zod schemas using `zod-openapi`
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript and Zod for type-safe API definitions
- **Multiple Formats**: Generates both JSON and YAML formats for maximum compatibility
- **Rich Descriptions**: Supports detailed descriptions, examples, and metadata for each endpoint

#### Usage

1. **Generate Documentation**: Run `npm run openapi` to generate the latest API documentation
2. **View Documentation**: The generated files are saved in the `docs/openapi/` directory:
   - `docs/openapi/<package-name>.openapi.json` - JSON format for programmatic use
   - `docs/openapi/<package-name>.openapi.yaml` - YAML format for human readability

3. **Schema Definitions**: API schemas are defined in `src/models/` with OpenAPI extensions
4. **Route Definitions**: OpenAPI route configurations are in `src/openapi/routes/`

#### Example Schema Definition

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

export const userSchema = z
  .strictObject({
    id: z.string().uuid(),
    name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
    email: z.string().email(),
  })
  .meta({
    description: 'User object with basic information',
    id: 'User'
    example: {
      id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    },
  })
```

The documentation can be viewed using any OpenAPI/Swagger UI tool or integrated into your API gateway.

### 🧪 Testing and Coverage

- **Unit testing**: Powered by [vitest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)

- **Code coverage**: Ensure high code quality and test coverage with Vitest’s built-in coverage reporting

### ⚡ Performance Optimization

- **Hot-reload**: Streamline development with automatic server reload using Node's native `--watch`

### 🔑 Secrets Management

## 🧩 Scripts

### Test

- `npm run test`: Runs Vitest tests. It will execute all the test cases written in the project without coverage reporting.
- `npm run test:coverage`: Runs Vitest tests with coverage reporting. It generates a code coverage report showing which parts of the code are covered by tests.
- `npm run test:watch`: Runs Vitest tests in watch mode. It watches for changes in the codebase and automatically reruns tests when files are modified.

### Update

- `npm run updates`: Runs npm-check-updates, a tool that checks for the latest versions of dependencies in the package.json and shows which packages can be updated.
- `npm run updates:interactive`: Runs npm-check-updates in interactive mode, allowing you to select which packages to update.
- `npm run updates:upgrade`: Automatically update the versions of dependencies in the package.json to the latest versions.

### Dependencies

- `npm run depcheck`: Runs depcheck, a tool that checks how each dependency is used, which dependencies are useless, and which dependencies are missing from package.json

### Documentation

- `npm run openapi`: Generates OpenAPI/Swagger documentation from Zod schemas. Creates _openapi.json_ and _openapi.yaml_ files under _docs/openapi/_ containing the complete API specification that can be used with Swagger UI or other OpenAPI tools.

### Linting and Formatting

- `npm run lint`: Runs oxlint to check for issues in the code. It will output warnings and errors according to the rules defined in the oxlint configuration.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Runs oxlint with the --fix flag, which automatically fixes any issues it can. It’s useful for cleaning up common problems.
- `npm run format`: Runs oxfmt to format the code. It will rewrite the code to follow a consistent style, ensuring things like indentation and line breaks are uniform across the codebase.
- `npm run format:check`: Runs oxfmt in check mode. It verifies that files conform to the formatting rules without modifying them, returning a non-zero exit code if differences are found (useful for CI pipelines).
- `npm run lint-staged`: Runs lint-staged, which executes oxlint and oxfmt only on staged files according to the configuration in .lintstagedrc. This allows for faster pre-commit checks by only processing files that are about to be committed rather than the entire codebase.

### Development

- `npm run dev`: Runs the development server. This tool watches for changes in TypeScript files and automatically restarts the server.
- `npm run debug`: Runs the server in debugging mode using the --inspect flag. This allows to attach a debugger to the Node.js process, enabling step-through debugging.

### Type Checking

- `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler with `--noEmit` to check for type errors without producing output files.

### Production

- `npm run prod`: Runs the application directly with Node.js (using native TypeScript support). This script is for running the app in production.

### Husky Prepare

- `npm run prepare`: Runs the Husky setup. It prepares the Git hooks (like pre-commit and commit-msg hooks) by setting up the necessary files. This is typically used after installing or updating Husky.

## 🔄 GitHub Workflows

This project includes a **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs automatically on:

- **Push** to `main` or `develop` branches
- **Pull requests** targeting `main` or `develop` (on open and synchronize events)
